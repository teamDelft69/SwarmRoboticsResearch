# Agents overview

## Damper Agent

- agent that makes use of the spring and damper model. Does not work very well due to oscilations.

## Boids Agent

- agent that uses the boids as a base model.Works better than the damper agent, however obstacle avoidance as well as enemy avoidance are yet to be improved.

## A* Boids Agent

- similar to the boids agent, but makes use of the A* algorithm as a main engine behind the steering force. Aims to improve obstacle avoidance.
