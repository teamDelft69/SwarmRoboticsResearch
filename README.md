# SwarmRoboticsResearch
This repository contains all the code-bases used as part of the research project 'Robust distributed swarming of wheeled mobile robots'. The papers corresponding to the performed research can be found on the following page: https://cse3000-research-project.github.io/2022/Q4. The research was performed in May and June 2022 as part of a TU Delft course.  This repository contains the code0bases of various people and its purpose is to simplify the code submission process. This github account (teamDelft69) is the common property of all the students that took part in the research (the names of those students are listed below). No rights over the code published on this repository (teamDelft69/SwarmRoboticsResearch) can be derived from ownership of this github account (teamDelft69) or this github repository (teamDelft69/SwarmRoboticsResearch). The code-bases hosted on the repositories owned by each of the authors should be considered official, not the ones on this repository (teamDelft69/SwarmRoboticsResearch). The links to each of those repositories can be found below, near the names of the students that took part in the research.
